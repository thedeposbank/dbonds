Being inspired by the [@dGoods](https://dGoods.org) project we decided to create
a dBonds standard.
dBonds is an open source and free standard for creating virtual obligations which
may or may not have collateral inside and can represent either true loan, 
securitization of fiat-based bond or even classic derivative option for crypto asset.
Here is no liquidation/margin call protocol of any kind and it is built on other incentives.

dBonds is a platform only for initial debt sales. Nevertheless, once debt is
tokenized and sold, it can be traded on secondary market just like other tokens.

======================================

This standard is a cornerstone of our main project [Depos](https://depos.io),
where we want to build transparent, stable and most liquid stablecoin and 
financial system around. Though, we think that dBonds might be usefull for various
different users.

We see how dBonds can help with the decentralized debt market to appear.
On the one hand that may be REPO market, peer-to-peer funding market for 
decentralized margin trading, decentralized derivatives.
On the other hand dBonds can be a tool for institutional debts and can bring
fixed income instruments into the crypto space and EOS blockchain in particular.
